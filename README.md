# Converting-Wood-into-Pulp

The Kraft process is a process of converting wood into pulp, which consists almost entirely of cellulose fibers, the main component of paper. The kraft process involves treating the wood chips with a hot mixture of water, sodium hydroxide, and sodium sulfide, known as “white liquor,” which breaks up the fibers of the wood, separating the lignin. and cellulose hemicellulose. The Kamyr digester allows the Kraft process to be carried out continuously. The quality of the pulp is measured by its residual lignin content: Kappa value.
